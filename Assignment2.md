## FOUR AREAS - FOCUS IS DATA MANAGEMENT
AREA                      | DESCRIPTION
---                             | ---
***Data Mining and Management***                 | ***&nbsp;***
What is it; Why is it important       | In cybersecurity, machine learning algorithms use data minging techniques to improve their ability to detect a wider range of cyber attacks. Teams can also employ reinforcement learning to automate repetitive tasks, resulting in more efficient IT and security processes. This ensures a reliable, secure, and accurate data analysis process. Organizations that engage in data mining and data management processes can a gain a competitive advantage with a better understanding of consumer behavior, efficient oversight of business operations, improved customer acquisition, and new growth opportunities.

What do you know        | In my career, I have learned about different code libraries used for data manipulation and visualization. Data is powerful, but only if you know how to use it. I have taken courses in Python and SQL to aid in my ability to access and manipulate data stored in databases. In my current professional role, my team uses data to make predictions and derive insights to aid leadership in making critical business decsiions. An important component of my job responsibilities is to become proficient in the process of data manipulation and work with more complex interrelated multi-table databases. Languages like python are used in software and web development, data science, machine learning, and many other fields. In this degree, I've taken courses to gain the basic concepts of Python, but in my professional work I also build real-life projects and solve different coding challenges. Data mining can look very different across applications, but the overall process can be used with almost any new or legacy application. Essentially any type of data can be gathered and analyzed, and almost every business problem that relies on qualifiable evidence can be tackled using data mining. The end goal of data mining is to take raw bits of information and determine if there is cohesion or correlation among the data. This benefit of data mining allows a company to create value with the information they have on hand that would otherwise not be overly apparent. Though data models can be complex, they can also yield fascinating results, unearth hidden trends, and suggest unique strategies. There are two main types of data mining: predictive data mining and descriptive data mining. Predictive data mining extracts data that may be helpful in determining an outcome. Description data mining informs users of a given outcome.
Where are you weak        | I believe an area of improvement I can focus on is the complexity of data mining. Data analytics often requires technical skill sets and specific software tools. Unless you get lucky and work for an updated or larger company, most smaller companies have a barrier of entry as they do not have the funding to have certain softwares available for their staff to use. Another thing I need more professional Data mining doesn't always guarantee results. A company may perform statistical analysis, make conclusions based on strong data, implement changes, and not reap any benefits. Through inaccurate findings, market changes, model errors, or inappropriate data populations, data mining can only guide decisions and not ensure outcomes. The amount of variables to consider can be vast and gaining the understanding of the appropriate steps to take requires experience I'm still working to build. Data is everywhere and used across business enterprise. Engineers and designers can analyze the effectiveness of product changes and look for possible causes of product success or failure related to how, when, and where products are used. Service and repair operations can better plan parts inventory and staffing. Professional service organizations can use data mining to identify new opportunities from changing economic trends and demographic shifts. Data mining becomes more useful and valuable with bigger data sets and with more user experience. Logically, the more data, the more insights and intelligence should be buried there. Also, as users get more familiar with the tools and better understand the database, the more creative they can be with their explorations and analyses.
What do you wish you knew and/or don't realize you are missing        | Something I hadn't considered previously when it comes to data management was the cost component. Data tools may require costly subscriptions, and some bits of data may be expensive to obtain. Personal information can require tokens in order to store or use. Security and privacy concerns can be pacified, though additional IT infrastructure can then run quite costly as well. Data mining may be most effective when using huge data sets however, these data sets must be stored and require heavy computational power to analyze. Data mining is seen by many executives as a way to help them better understand demand and to see the effect that changes in products, pricing, or promotion have on sales. But what everyone, including myself, tends to not focus on is the cost to create the insights they view in a visualization supplied by automated data stored in a warehouse.

QUESTION                      | RESPONSE - In  Progress
---                             | ---
•	Why Data Management is integratable with the other areas       | *The principles and issues of managing organizational data is paramount for IT and business. The application of the concepts of database systems emphasizing data storage, queries, database models and languages related to database design and implementation all build an end goal of management and usage of data, online analytical processing, and data mining tools and techniques. All of which aid in the gathering of necessary data attributes which can be used to determine data analytics and insights. This is why Data Management is a critical segement of the degree plan.*
•	How Data Management is integratable with the other areas       | *The study of the extraction and transformation of data from external sources to include cleansing, normalizing, and repairing in preparation for use in data platforms is key in shaping how Data Management integrates alongside the three other areas of Data nalyticst, Systems Development and Networking and Cybersecurity. Using the tools and techniques of data mining and data management, organizations can understand how to improve their business on several levels by optimizing their database design, storage and processes.*
•	How Data Management is integratable with your prior work       | *In my career, data mining is a process used to sort large data sets to identify patterns and relationships that can help solve business problems through data analysis. Data mining techniques and tools enable enterprises to predict future trends and make more-informed business decisions.*
