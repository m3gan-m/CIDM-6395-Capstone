# CIDM6395 - Assignment 2
Develop a 2-3 page assessment of your competency in Data Management with the elements of supporting evidence.  

# Evolution 2 - Assessing Data Management

>For each evolution, assess and develop an account of the follow for each of the aspects of developing a portfolio of what you've accomplished in the curriculum:
>    - What do you know - Competencies, skills, and knowledge where you are the most confident and proficient
>    - Where are you weak - Competencies, skills, and knowledge where you are the lest confident and proficient
>    - What do you wish you knew and/or don't realize you are missing

## FOUR AREAS - FOCUS IS DATA MANAGEMENT
AREA                      | DESCRIPTION
---                             | ---
***Data Mining and Management***                 | ***&nbsp;***
What is it; Why is it important       | In cybersecurity, machine learning algorithms use data minging techniques to improve their ability to detect a wider range of cyber attacks. Teams can also employ reinforcement learning to automate repetitive tasks, resulting in more efficient IT and security processes. This ensures a reliable, secure, and accurate data analysis process.

•	Why Data Management is integratable with the other areas       | *The application of business intelligence using logistic regression, linear regression modeling, hypotheses testing, machine learning tools, and predictive modeling all builds an end goal of practical application of statistical tools in business for any MS CISBA student and is why Data Analytics is a critical segement of the degree plan.*
•	How Data Management is integratable with the other areas       | *The study of the creation, acquisition and analysis of data for the purpose of decision support is key in shaping how Data Anaytics integrates alongside the three other areas of Data Mining and Management, Systems development and Networking and Cybersecurity. Using the results of data analytics, organizations can understand how to improve their business on several levels by optimiinge their business processes, creating more persuasive marketing campaigns, retaining more employees or even offering greater customer personalization.*
•	How Data Management is integratable with your prior work       | *In my career, understanding how to use fact-based analytics in support of business strategy, how to gather relevant data, and to use specific software tools to analyze data is critical to performing the roles I have held and aspire to continue growth in. The team I am a part of concurrently works to build both a data anaytics and data integration pipeline. Data integration aids data analytics through efficiently pulling information from various sources, refining it, and overall collecting it so that it’s easier to understand and mine for insights. The two go hand in hand.*

•	What new statement can you make that that demonstrates that these all fit       | TBD
