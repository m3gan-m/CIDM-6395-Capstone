# CIDM6395 - Assignment 2
Develop a 2-3 page assessment of your competency in Data Management with the elements of supporting evidence.  

# Evolution 2 - Assessing Data Management

>For each evolution, assess and develop an account of the follow for each of the aspects of developing a portfolio of what you've accomplished in the curriculum:
>    - What do you know - Competencies, skills, and knowledge where you are the most confident and proficient
>    - Where are you weak - Competencies, skills, and knowledge where you are the lest confident and proficient
>    - What do you wish you knew and/or don't realize you are missing

## FOUR AREAS - FOCUS IS DATA MANAGEMENT
AREA                      | DESCRIPTION
---                             | ---
***Data Mining and Management***                 | ***&nbsp;***
What is it; Why is it important       | In cybersecurity, machine learning algorithms use data minging techniques to improve their ability to detect a wider range of cyber attacks. Teams can also employ reinforcement learning to automate repetitive tasks, resulting in more efficient IT and security processes. This ensures a reliable, secure, and accurate data analysis process. Organizations that engage in data mining and data management processes can a gain a competitive advantage with a better understanding of consumer behavior, efficient oversight of business operations, improved customer acquisition, and new growth opportunities.

What do you know        | Add here. learn about different Python libraries used for data manipulation and visualization. Data is powerful, but only if you know how to use it. That’s where SQL comes in! In this course, you’ll learn how to use the SQL standardized database language to access and manipulate data stored in databases. Once you know how to use SQL, you’ll be able to join top companies (and even governments!) who use data to make predictions and decisions about everything from what products to develop to how democracy should function. ake your database query skills to the next level with this second SQL course. Often, you need multiple tables in order to keep data integrity and avoid duplication. In this course, we’ll teach you how to easily deal with more than one table. Master the process of data manipulation and work with more complex interrelated multi-table databases. Python is a popular, easy-to-learn, and very powerful programming language, which is used in software and web development, data science, machine learning, and many other fields. In this course, we’ll cover the basic concepts of Python, as well as build real-life projects and solve different coding challenges.

QUESTION                      | RESPONSE - In  Progress
---                             | ---
•	Why Data Management is integratable with the other areas       | *The principles and issues of managing organizational data is paramount for IT and business. The application of the concepts of database systems emphasizing data storage, queries, database models and languages related to database design and implementation all build an end goal of management and usage of data, online analytical processing, and data mining tools and techniques. All of which aid in the gathering of necessary data attributes which can be used to determine data analytics and insights. This is why Data Management is a critical segement of the degree plan.*
•	How Data Management is integratable with the other areas       | *The study of the extraction and transformation of data from external sources to include cleansing, normalizing, and repairing in preparation for use in data platforms is key in shaping how Data Management integrates alongside the three other areas of Data nalyticst, Systems Development and Networking and Cybersecurity. Using the tools and techniques of data mining and data management, organizations can understand how to improve their business on several levels by optimizing their database design, storage and processes.*
•	How Data Management is integratable with your prior work       | *In my career, data mining is a process used to sort large data sets to identify patterns and relationships that can help solve business problems through data analysis. Data mining techniques and tools enable enterprises to predict future trends and make more-informed business decisions.*
&nbsp;
•	What new statement can you make that that demonstrates that these all fit       | TBD
