What is it; Why is it important        | Integrating data analysis in software and system development is a must. Doing so enables data-driven decision-making throughout the different areas of the development process. Data-driven decisions lead to more successful outcomes and reduced development risks. Data analytics can help identify performance issues whie software development can aid in creating tools to collect data. Both work done by a data analyst and a software developer are important and hold equal value in the the current day and digital world. While anaysis can be done manually, using the proper software and systems will help an analyst work more efficiently with data, especially when investigating larger data sets. Data science is an iterative process when it comes to testing and evaluating data to ensure algorithms are working correctly. Software engineering can automate testing so these individuals can spend more time development algorithms instead of manually testing.

•	Why Software Systems is integratable with the other areas       | *The process of creating computer programs, applications, and systems is known as software development. There are different methods like coding, testing, and designing. These help meet the client's requirements. Software development is used to integrate various applications. It is used in different industries like entertainment education, healthcare, and finance. Data-Driven software development is the process of developing software by using data. An analytics software engineer can help organizations with this process. A quck list as to why software/systems integrates with data anlytics is as follows: 1. Data driven decision making - Data analytics provides insights and patterns hidden in large volumnes of data. By integrating data analytics into software, organizations can make informed decisions based on data rather than relying on past history or intuition. It allows businesses to understand customer behaviour, identify trends, detect anomlaies and optimize processes. 2. Improved performance and efficiency - integrating software allows businesses to streamline operations, identify bottlenecks and find areas of improvement. 3. Personalization and customization - software and systems, once integrated with analytics, can leverage insights and tailor the information for user experiences and deliver targeted material. For some, this can lead to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty. 4. Predictive and prescriptive analytics - the integration of software can enable organizations to anticipate customer demands, forecast market trends and optimize resource allocations. This allows a business to make proactive decisions and take actions to achieve their desired outcomes. 5. Data visualization and reporting - software tools integrate analytics to present inforation in an intiutive manner to achieve a quick platform for stkaeholders to  make decisions with. *
•	How Software Systems is integratable with the other areas       | *Data analytics and software development are very closely related. Both play a major role in modern business. Software development includes all work in creating, designing and maintaining software application. Data analytics use these applications to process data and overall together - this improves busness decisions and gain insights. There are various successful ways in which data analytics can be integrated into the software development process. The best technique for incorporating data analytics is to have a clear understanding of the problem to be solved. The data needs to be identified and appropriate data analytics tools are used to develop solutions that address the business problem. Next, to establish a data-driven culture the team needs to be encouraged to use data for making informed decisions. Training and resources can be provided to the development team to enhance their efficiency. Third, as data analytics can analyze user behavior and identify poor performance thus it can help improve the software. It can reduce potential security risks and strengthen the usability of the software. Finally, the data analytics processes and decision-making can be improved over time. This is helpful for organizations that depend on data during decisions.*
•	How Software Systems is integratable with your prior work       | *In my career, there is an increased use of data and software when studying data across the enterprise, from Member Identity Access Management to Financials to Workforce. These complex systems are full of large data sets needed to solve complex problems. 
Overall, the combination of software and systems to create wonderful applications enable data analytics to be at the most efficency and therfore provide keen insights. This results in enhanced performance and growth for not just our company but any which follows a similar method. Currently, within our organization more effort is being prioritized on automation, artifical intelligence and machine learning. This is to help increase the focus on privacy, security and ethics. My role is only enhanced by system development as it removes manual and tedious processes so more focus can be placed on the truly important matters.*
•	What new statement can you make that that demonstrates that these all fit       | TBD
