# CIDM6395 - Assignment 3
Develop a 2-3 page assessment of your competency in Software and Systems with the elements of supporting evidence.  

# Evolution 3 - Assessing Software Systems

>For each evolution, assess and develop an account of the follow for each of the aspects of developing a portfolio of what you've accomplished in the curriculum:
>    - What do you know - Competencies, skills, and knowledge where you are the most confident and proficient
>    - Where are you weak - Competencies, skills, and knowledge where you are the lest confident and proficient
>    - What do you wish you knew and/or don't realize you are missing

What is it; Why is it important        | Integrating data analysis in software and system development is a must. Doing so enables data-driven decision-making throughout the different areas of the development process. Data-driven decisions lead to more successful outcomes and reduced development risks. Data analytics can help identify performance issues whie software development can aid in creating tools to collect data. Both work done by a data analyst and a software developer are important and hold equal value in the the current day and digital world. While anaysis can be done manually, using the proper software and systems will help an analyst work more efficiently with data, especially when investigating larger data sets. Data science is an iterative process when it comes to testing and evaluating data to ensure algorithms are working correctly. Software engineering can automate testing so these individuals can spend more time development algorithms instead of manually testing.

•	Why Software Systems is integratable with the other areas       | *The process of creating computer programs, applications, and systems is known as software development. There are different methods like coding, testing, and designing. These help meet the client's requirements. Software development is used to integrate various applications. It is used in different industries like entertainment education, healthcare, and finance. Data-Driven software development is the process of developing software by using data. An analytics software engineer can help organizations with this process.*
•	How Software Systems is integratable with the other areas       | *Data analytics and software development are very closely related. Both play a major role in modern business. Software development includes all work in creating, designing and maintaining software application. Data analytics use these applications to process data and overall together - this improves busness decisions and gain insights. There are various successful ways in which data analytics can be integrated into the software development process*The best technique for incorporating data analytics is to have a clear understanding of the problem to be solved. The data needs to be identified and appropriate data analytics tools are used to develop solutions that address the business problem.
*To establish a data-driven culture the team needs to be encouraged to use data for making informed decisions. Training and resources can be provided to the development team to enhance their efficiency.
*As data analytics can analyze user behavior and identify poor performance thus it can help improve the software. It can reduce potential security risks and strengthen the usability of the software.
*The data analytics processes and decision-making can be improved over time. This is helpful for organizations that depend on data during decisions.*
•	How Software Systems is integratable with your prior work       | *In my career, ....*
•	What new statement can you make that that demonstrates that these all fit       | TBD
