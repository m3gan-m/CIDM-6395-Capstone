## FOUR AREAS
AREA                      | DESCRIPTION
---                             | ---
***Data Analytics***        | ***&nbsp;***
What is it; Why is it important?        | Data analytics is integral to business because it allows leadership to create evidence-based strategy, understand customers to better target marketing initiatives, and increase overall productivity. A data analyst’s role is to organize, interpret, and extract valuable insights from data sets in order to support a company in making data-driven decisions. Through knowing and analyzing information, data analysts can make data informed recommendations on how to offer a stronger product or service.

CIDM 5310        | [https://github.com/m3gan-m/CIDM5310](https://github.com/m3gan-m/CIDM5310)
CIDM 6308        | [https://github.com/m3gan-m/CIDM-6308](https://github.com/m3gan-m/CIDM-6308)
What do you know        | In my role as a Decision Science Analyst, I am expected to provide decision support by answering business objectives and drive change for business areas across the enterprise. This is accomplished through applying mathematical and statistical techniques and any innovative quantitative analytical approaches to draw conclusions and aid in the ability to make “insight to action” recommendations. As I have been an analyst for a few years now, I feel most confident in my data gathering and synthesizing skills. I am very familiar with taking a set of data, finding relevant attributes, transactions, patterns and behaviors and then drawing conclusions which aid in implementing strategies. I also have background in reviewing risks associated with business activities ensuring they are effectively identified, measured, monitored and controlled. The team I am a part of provides data analytics for both the PMO and enterprise so those of us in our group are highly familiar with the process of investigating, organizing, transforming, and modeling data in order to help the organization gain a competitive advantage. Our work is crucial in analyzing vast volumes of data in order to discover patterns and gain valuable insights that lead to a greater understanding of a particular problem or situation. Project management is also an area I am very confident in. Not only have I spent over a decade performing this type of work, I am also PMP certified. Data gathering for project charters, stakeholder reviews, roadmap planning and ongoing review of risks and impacts comes almost second nature to me now and has shaped some of the ways I think through problems.
Where are you weak        | While I have some experience, I would say I do not have any advanced knowledge of some of the more common data analysis tools, data visualization programs such as Tableau, nor developing anything beyond basic analysis queries in SQL, SAS or other BI tools. I ultimately am seeking to become more proficient in these areas but understand I will need training and personal experience to build those skills. In my current role, part of my development plan is to begin working with Tableau visualization creation for dashboards. While data is plentiful, the linking of key attributes is not and nor is simplified dashboards for business executives to review current state or trends in order to make decisions for next steps forward. Another area of Data Analytics I feel I need  more profciency in is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In our organizations, this is described as a data analysis method that helps with the initial exploration of data in order to identify basic patterns, trends, correlations, and anomalies. EDA may require descriptive statistics, data visualization techniques, and data querying. MModeling and descriptive statistics is something I still am gaining footing in and working towards developing more.
What do you wish you knew and/or don't realize you are missing        | Through the Data Analytics courses I have taken so far through this degree, I have found I need better practice and experience completing certain processes using REST API, VPS servers, myPHPadmin, Jupyter notebooks, etc. During the semester I completed CIDM 5310, I worked through many challenges in understanding how to set these programs up to function properly, sometimes needing reinstalls due to needing to reset a root password. While the concept of using some programs seems straightforward, the actual work while in them felt more complicated and less intuitive. I feel spending more time with peers or instructors could aid in learning best use methods for completing necessary actions.

***Data Mining and Management***                 | ***&nbsp;***
What is it; Why is it important       | In cybersecurity, machine learning algorithms use data minging techniques to improve their ability to detect a wider range of cyber attacks. Teams can also employ reinforcement learning to automate repetitive tasks, resulting in more efficient IT and security processes. This ensures a reliable, secure, and accurate data analysis process.

***Systems Development***                 | ***&nbsp;***
What is it; Why is it important        | Integrating data analysis in software and system development is a must. Doing so enables data-driven decision-making throughout the different areas of the development process. Data-driven decisions lead to more successful outcomes and reduced development risks.

***Networking and Cybersecurity***                 | ***&nbsp;***
What is it; Why is it important        | A large benefit of big data analytics for networking and cybersecurity is to detect and respond to digital threats. Being quick and effortless is key. Data anlysis tools can provide detailed alerts and reports, outlining the nature and severity of a problem and tips to mitigate future digital threat attempts. Combining data mining and cybersecurity allows for determining features of cyber attacks and improving attack detection processes long term.
