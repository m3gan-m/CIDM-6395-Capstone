***Relationship***                 | ***List below***
Definition           | A relationship in an ERD defines how two entities are related to each other. They can be derived from verbs when speaking about a database or a set of entities.

***Attribute***                 | ***List below***
Definition         | An attribute is a property of an entity or something that can be used to describe an entity. They are often represented as ovals, or as entries inside an entity.
There are several different types of attributes represented on an ERD:         | Simple: an attribute that cannot be split into other attributes, such as a first name.
&nbsp;        | Composite: an attribute that can be split into other attributes, such as name being split into first, middle, and last name.
&nbsp;       | Derived: an attribute that is calculated or determined from another attribute, such as the age of record being calculated from the created date.
